# GPS-Receiver
This repository consists of the processing of the recieved GPS signals at the receiver side. MATLAB has been put to use. MATLAB to HDL may be used for running it on an FPGA.

## Overview
The main processes which typically occur at the receiver side are as follows:
1. Acquisition
2. Tracking

Tracking part further consists of code and carrier tracking. The project focusses on the tracking part, more specifically, carrier tracking.
